# Basic Information
  - The data structures and other codes I posted under this repository are from CS5343 at UT Dallas.
  - I've accomplished this course with an A, however, I found it was better to put the concepts covered in the class into implementation, since it is a good way to have a deeper understanding of the basic data structures like trees, graphs, list, etc.
  - This repository will update from time to time, as I have other courses and ongoing projects. Stay tuned.
  - If you have some questions or find some errors in my codes, feel free to leave a comment.
